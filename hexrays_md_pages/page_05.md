![Welcome to Hex-Rays IDA Community Forum](https://hex-rays.com/hubfs/enterprise%204.png)

It's been a long time coming and we're happy to say that we just launched our brand new Discourse community forum. 

If you’re familiar with our previous forum, you’ll know that while it was informative and useful, it was a closed system with limited discoverability and wasn’t able to have the type of active participation and engagement we all desired. Knowing that your input and the IDA community as a whole have so much to offer, we needed a more robust platform that would give us a way to connect and communicate in a more modern fashion. Enter Discourse.

[[Jump to Hex-Rays Discourse]](<https://community.hex-rays.com/>)

# **What to Expect**

This new platform is designed to be your go-to spot for everything Hex-Rays. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just getting started with our tools, Discourse is here to make your life easier. Here's a quick rundown of what you'll find:

  * **Company News & Announcements**: Get all the latest updates about Hex-Rays, from new case studies to upcoming events and everything in between.
  * **Product Updates** : We’ll keep you posted on new features, bug fixes, and other changes to our products. 
  * **Documentation** : Access detailed documentation to help you get the most out of our products. We’re talking guides, tutorials, tips and tricks, and so on.
  * **Discussions & Community**: Have a question? Want to share a cool use case? The platform is set up for engaging informative discussions. Get answers from our team, and/or chat with fellow users who are just as passionate as you are and are ready to help.
  * **And Much More** : We’re constantly working to improve, so stay tuned for additional content.



# **Why Discourse?**

We chose Discourse because it's a platform that encourages thoughtful discussions, organized content, and community-driven collaboration. Plus, it’s pretty easy on the eyes (we know, we know—looks aren’t everything, but they don’t hurt either). Whether you’re browsing on a desktop or mobile, Discourse makes it simple to find what you need and interact with others.

# **Get Involved**

Getting started is a breeze. Simply head over to [Hex-Rays Community Forum](<https://community.hex-rays.com/>), sign up, and dive into the discussions. Wherever you are in your IDA journey, our goal is to provide content that will help you feel more connected and get the most out of the product. 

Got feedback? We’d love to hear from you. We believe we have a great foundation to build off of, but this is your platform, so help us make it the best it can be. And who knows, you might even get a mention in a future update.

If you have any questions, please visit our [Support page](<https://get.support.hex-rays.com/servicedesk/customer/portals>) to get in touch with the right team.

Hex-Rays ✦ Posted: Dec 19, 2024

![Product Update: IDA 9.0sp1 Release](https://hex-rays.com/hubfs/ida-9.jpg)

We are pleased to announce the release of the first IDA 9.0 Service Pack (sp1).

This Service Pack focuses on bugfixes, along with IDAPython API and SDK enhancements that introduce new and simplified endpoints, and IDA Feeds improvements. 

Below is a summary and you can read the detailed release notes [here](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/release-notes/9_0sp1>).

You can download the latest IDA installer from [My Hex-Rays](<https://my.hex-rays.com/dashboard/download-center/downloads>), our customer portal.

# **IDAPython / SDK improvements**

We've added several helpers to improve our API user experience. These new endpoints, among other things, streamline managing and operating on types. You can review the complete change log [here](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/release-notes/9_0sp1#idapython-sdk-improvements>).

We also have a few other goodies to assist with accessibility and usage of our API: 

  * An updated [Porting Guide](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/developer-guide/idapython/idapython-porting-guide-ida-9>) which reflects recent API improvements
  * New [IDAPython examples](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/developer-guide/idapython/idapython-examples#types>), mainly for the **Working with types** category
  * Revamped IDAPython [reference documentation](<https://python.docs.hex-rays.com/>) to improve cross-referencing



# **IDA Feeds**

IDA Feeds (aka FLIRT Signature Manager) was released with IDA 9.0. The tool is designed to simplify the application of new signatures through updatable libraries, known as IDA FLIRT Signature Bundles, shipped alongside other out-of-the-box IDA plugins. IDA FLIRT signature bundles are available as a separate download from [My Hex-Rays](<https://my.hex-rays.com/dashboard/download-center/downloads>) as well. 

Read more about IDA Feeds and the recently updated signature bundles [here](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/user-guide/plugins/plugins-shipped-with-ida/ida-feeds>). 

  


**Improvements:****__** We have streamlined the IDA Feeds plugin execution and resolved issues with loading when idalib could not be located or was not correctly installed. IDA Feeds can now run without explicitly installing idalib. Additionally, there are UI enhancements to make the plugin experience more intuitive. 

Review the IDA Feeds configuration and setup guide [here](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/user-guide/plugins/plugins-shipped-with-ida/ida-feeds#ida-feeds-configuration-and-setup>), and the complete change log [here](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/release-notes/9_0sp1#ida-feeds-improvements>).

# **UI Improvements, Bugfixes and More**

  * UI and other improvements can be viewed [here](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/release-notes/9_0sp1#ui-improvements>).

  * A complete list of bugfixes can be viewed [here](<https://docs.hex-rays.com/release-notes/9_0sp1#complete-list-of-bugfixes>).

Hex-Rays ✦ Posted: Oct 9, 2024

![Madame de Maintenon tells us everything about IDA 9.0, subscriptions, ownership, and her new appearance](https://hex-rays.com/hubfs/ITW-Maintenon-blog.jpg)

**An interview with Madame de Maintenon**

Q: A lot has happened at Hex-Rays in the past week: a major new release with IDA 9.0, the launch of IDA Classroom and IDA Pro OEM, Teams and Private Lumina becoming add-ons, a new website, a customer portal for downloading license keys, updated technical documentation, and even changes to subscription terms. So, what’s the latest, Your Ladyship?

[Madame de Maintenon] Indeed, it’s been quite an eventful week for our users! One of the key highlights is our new customer portal, where users can now download installers, utility binaries, and their IDA license keys—no need to email us anymore for those. In the future, customers will be able to manage their entire license base, view their order history, and access invoices through the portal. It will also provide access to data feeds, like signature bundles, which users can opt to download. 

As soon as we launched, some of our most enthusiastic users were already trying to break into the system to get their hands on unpaid license keys. This caused some issues, and we sincerely apologize if anyone experienced trouble downloading their keys for the new IDA 9.0. We’re also working on making the process for obtaining IDA Free licenses more straightforward, and we expect most of the open cases to be resolved by now. As always, our valued customers are welcome to reach out to our support team at [support@hex-rays.com](<mailto:support@hex-rays.com>) if they encounter any issues.

Q: I came across a social media post claiming that the new IDA prices have almost quadrupled. Is that true?

[Madame de Maintenon] Oh, that doesn’t sound right at all! In fact, with the shift to a subscription model, IDA Pro licenses, on average, are **45% cheaper** to get started with compared to the former perpetual licenses. For example, the new IDA Pro Essential package, which includes two cloud-based decompilers, is now priced at just $/€ 1,099 per year, and the IDA Pro Expert-2, with two local decompilers, is now available for $/€ 2,999 per year. Under the previous perpetual model, these packages were priced at $/€ 5,862, so the new pricing offers **upfront savings of 81% and 49%** , respectively. Over a typical customer lifecycle—let's say four years—the overall **cost under the subscription model will be comparable to what customers would have paid under the previous perpetual model** with annual support renewals. For example, under perpetual licensing, a user would pay 'X' in the first year, and 40% of 'X' in each subsequent year for support, adding up to **2.2X** over four years. With subscriptions, customers pay an average of 0.55X annually, also totaling **2.2X** over the same period. 

Customers now also benefit from **clearer discount options**. For example, committing to a **3-year subscription** reduces the annual cost to **0.48X** , and with the highest volume discount applied, the price can drop even further to **0.34X** per year.**** These are average figures across the board, but rest assured, we’re committed to making the transition as smooth as possible. If any pricing issues arise, we’ll address them immediately.

Q: Despite the price reductions, is it possible that some existing customers might see their bill go up?

[Madame de Maintenon] We’re committed to ensuring that it doesn’t happen, and we strongly encourage customers to reach out if their calculations suggest otherwise. There are a few cases we are particularly mindful of a) Long-standing customers who don’t frequently purchase new licenses may not immediately see the savings outlined above. We are dedicated to making their transition as smooth as possible, so they should definitely get in touch. b) Customers who mainly use IDA as a disassembler and don’t need decompilers should also contact us, as we have tailored solutions for their specific needs. c) For those who previously bought an odd number of decompilers and are now only seeing even-numbered package options, there’s no need to worry. You can move to a plan with one additional decompiler (e.g., Expert-6 if you had 5) while paying the price of the lower plan (Expert-4).

We encourage all existing customers to reach out for a quote or guidance on selecting the right package for their needs.

**Q:** I’ve heard there’s a new product called IDA Classroom that’s being offered free-of-charge. Is that correct?  


[Madame de Maintenon] Absolutely! As part of our commitment to supporting the next generation of professionals, we’re now offering **IDA with four decompilers completely free to universities, engineering schools, for-profit educational providers, and their students**. The supported processor architectures are the ones most commonly used in education—x86 and ARM, both in 32- and 64-bit versions. 

We also encourage professional trainers to reach out to learn more about our new IDA Classroom offering, which they can benefit from. Additionally, we’re offering a 70% discount on IDA Pro subscriptions for academic institutions and researchers who require the full power of IDA Pro. 

Finally, we’re committed to continuing to support students after they’ve completed their course that used IDA Classroom by offering **an extension to their Classroom subscription for one year free-of-charge** or at a 70% discount for those who want to use IDA Pro’s full capabilities.

**Q:** So, the free IDA Classroom subscriptions are now available to training companies as well, not just universities?

[Madame de Maintenon] Exactly! IDA Classroom is now **free for professional trainers and their students** for an entire year. These trainers can include malware analysis instructors, penetration testing coaches, or organizations offering cybersecurity risk training. They don’t need to be affiliated with a specific university or engineering school. However, the courses must be open to the public—so technically, I should be able to enroll if I wanted to. Those offering private courses, like corporate training or military academies, are not eligible.

**Q:** **Why did Hex-Rays move to a subscription model?**  


[Madame de Maintenon] In no particular order, here are a few reasons why we moved to a subscription model: **a)** The subscription model significantly reduces the upfront cost of using IDA, making it more accessible, **b)** While IDA Pro**** users will always have the option to use IDA in an air-gapped/offline environment, we're increasingly developing server-side services that depend on a robust hardware infrastructure. The new signature packs, available for download from our customer portal, are just one example—and many more are on the way. By adopting a subscription model, we can ensure continuous improvement and maintenance of these services without the limitations of a one-time purchase. Additionally, charging a one-off fee for our software while shouldering the ongoing costs of the back-end infrastructure is not sustainable in the long term, **c)** Regular subscription payments help us better forecast cash flow and avoid the challenges of chasing overdue payments - a real headache, honestly. It's very much like how employees appreciate the reliability of a regular salary.

This is a change for us all and I know our users will understand. After all, we did eventually stop buying CDs and switched to paid music platforms.

**Q:** **So, the licensing change has nothing to do with reports of Hex-Rays having a new owner?**  


[Madame de Maintenon] I understand there are a few myths floating around about Hex-Rays’ ownership. For example, Wikipedia suggests that the private equity fund Smartfin now owns Hex-Rays, but that’s not accurate. **Ilfak Guilfanov** , our founder (and my creator), along with **Hex-Rays employees** , are the largest shareholders of our parent company. Smartfin is a minority shareholder, offering valuable expertise in innovation and growth. Their involvement has already enabled significant investments in new products and features, and we’re confident that our customers will soon see the benefits of these initiatives.

Q: **Speaking of new features, what’s your favorite in IDA 9.0?**

[Madame de Maintenon] I must say, I love everything that’s been added to IDA 9.0. But if I had to pick, unearthing x64 exceptions is an incredibly powerful feature. It’s the brainchild of Rolf Rolles, who worked closely with the team to make it a reality. Right now, it works on code compiled by MSVC, and I’m excited about its potential. There have also been some fantastic UI improvements thanks to Julian, our product owner, and some of our passionate developers. Features like the idalib headless library, the RISC-V and nanoMIPS decompilers, and the WASM disassembler were highly anticipated, so they weren’t a huge surprise for most customers. However, the FLIRT signature manager and the new signature packs were unexpected delights, and we’ve already received great feedback on them—especially seeing multi-core processing at work in IDA! We’ve also taken the first steps to improve the usability of our APIs and plug-ins, and there are many more exciting innovations coming in that area.

Q: **How did you become the face of IDA? Could you share the full story?**

[Madame de Maintenon] Of course. Initially, Ilfak named the product 'The Interactive Disassembler,' which quickly became known as IDA. Back in the 2000s, the team was searching for a logo and considered using Ada Lovelace's likeness, given that her name sounds similar to IDA and she was the first to describe the workings of a theoretical computer. However, they struggled to find a good image of Ada online. That’s when Pierre Vandevenne, the founder of Datarescue, suggested that I audition for the role. I like to think it was my elegance and wit that won them over. And that’s how I became the face of the product!

Q: **There’s been quite a buzz around IDA 9.0, especially since it features a new logo that resembles a younger version of you. Could you tell us more about that?**

[Madame de Maintenon] *smiling and blushing* Oh, I’m truly flattered! The new portrait was revealed alongside IDA 9.0, and it does capture a more youthful version of myself. It was actually a wonderful gift from our team working on AI-powered tools. They gathered an impressive collection of paintings of me and used them to recreate a 'younger me.' Of course, the portrait displayed at the Château de Maintenon will always remain IDA’s official product logo. But for IDA 9.0, let’s just say I’ve indulged in a bit of an 'anti-aging' treatment!

Q: **And finally, can you confirm the long-standing rumor—did you secretly marry Louis XIV, the King of France?**

[Madame de Maintenon] *smiling mysteriously* I’ll leave that to the endless rumors circulating online. The internet seems to have a way of always knowing what really happened, don’t you think?

IDA 9.0 is here, loaded with a bunch of sleek improvements.

This release is amplified with new disassemblers and decompilers, such as the RISC-V decompiler, the disassembler support of T-Head instruction set for the XUANTIE-RV architecture, the nanoMIPS decompiler and disassembler, and the Web Assembly (WASM) disassembler.

We’ve also added headless processing with idalib, allowing the use of C++ and Python APIs outside IDA to form standalone applications.

The time for analysis has been significantly reduced, thanks to our new FLIRT Manager, which lists all available signatures and allows the user to apply them tentatively, and the thousands of new FLIRT signatures available as separate downloads.

Additionally, a significant advancement has been made with the C++ exceptions handling in the decompiler, giving the reverse engineers and malware analysts a powerful tool to unravel complex and obfuscated control flows.

Finally, we've got a range of user interface refinements.

For your convenience, we have highlighted the key features:

  * Headless processing with idalib
  * New RISC-V Decompiler and Disassembler Extensions
  * WASM Disassembler and File Format Loader
  * nanoMIPS support
  * C++ Exceptions Support in the Decompiler
  * IDAPython Improvements

![Unveiling IDA Pro 9.0: The New nanoMIPS Disassembler and Decompiler](https://hex-rays.com/hubfs/9.0-Hero.png)

We know many of you needed **nanoMIPS** support in IDA. In fact, there is support for MIPS, and even some plugins do a decent job of disassembling and decompiling nanoMIPS, but…it was pretty clear that we should have it in IDA by default. Before we get to the point of this blog post, some of you might not be familiar with that architecture, and therefore, we will just briefly brush up on what nanoMIPS is and why there is so much fuss about having it in IDA.

nanoMIPS is a variant of the MIPS architecture designed for embedded devices. Although nanoMIPS and MIPS have many similarities, the nano version uses a unique instruction encoding that compresses operations into smaller memory footprints, which increases its efficiency in constrained environments but also introduces complexity for reverse engineers.

Here comes the great news! **The MIPS disassembler and decompiler got added support for nanoMIPS instructions**. They will be **included in the upcoming IDA 9.0 release**. As you probably know (or don’t), firmware compiled for nanoMIPS often ships in md1rom format, which is why **we also added a md1rom file loader** to IDA (which includes parsing and applying of debug symbols, if available). The nanoMIPS support is included in the classic MIPS (HEXMIPS) decompiler, so if you already have the MIPS decompiler, you won’t need an additional decompiler.

Enough talking. Let’s look at some screenshots and see how IDA 9.0 deals with nanoMIPS:

![nanoMIPS-1](https://hex-rays.com/hs-fs/hubfs/nanoMIPS-1.png?width=815&height=846&name=nanoMIPS-1.png)

![nanoMIPS-2](https://hex-rays.com/hs-fs/hubfs/nanoMIPS-2.png?width=1600&height=1009&name=nanoMIPS-2.png)

This enhancement, introduced with the **September 30th release of IDA Pro 9.0** , sets the stage for even more sophisticated features in the future as IDA Pro continues to evolve alongside the complexity of modern software development.

![Unveiling IDA Pro 9.0: Introducing the FLIRT Manager And Thousands Of New Signatures](https://hex-rays.com/hubfs/9.0-Hero.png)

**FLIRT** technology has been around for quite some time. It was first introduced in IDA 3.6 in 1996, and since then, it has saved analysts long hours of manual work. We believe most of you already know what FLIRT is, but we’ll say a few words for those just starting with IDA. **The Fast Library Identification and Recognition Technology (FLIRT)** allows IDA to recognize standard library functions generated by supported compilers. It dramatically improves the disassembly listing by making it more readable. 

You might have noticed that we recently incorporated a convenient tool for generating FLIRT signatures from a current database – [the makesig plugin](<https://hex-rays.com/blog/an-overview-of-the-makesig-plugin/>). With this extension, users can migrate a list of functions that had already been reverse-engineered and exported as a signature file into the current binary. This tool was just the beginning of more exciting developments. 

**In IDA 9.0,** we’ve launched a new tool called **FLIRT Manager**. We will discuss this feature in a separate blog post, but in a few words, it lists all available signatures and allows the user to apply them tentatively (see the screenshots below). Perhaps one of the most valuable features of the FLIRT Manager is the ability to perform a multi-core analysis. Within the blink of an eye, you can analyze thousands of signatures if idalib is set up correctly. We also say goodbye to the singular double-clicking of all signature suggestions. Just bulk-select and the FLIRT Manager will do the hard part! 

![flirt-manager-1](https://hex-rays.com/hs-fs/hubfs/flirt-manager-1.jpg?width=1280&height=763&name=flirt-manager-1.jpg)

![flirt-manager-2](https://hex-rays.com/hs-fs/hubfs/flirt-manager-2.jpg?width=1280&height=764&name=flirt-manager-2.jpg)

On top of that, we’ve supercharged FLIRT by adding thousands of signatures as separate downloads! You can decide which one to use for your project and load it into IDA. Now, take a moment to explore the signatures we’ve built in the new release:

  * Golang:
    * Versions: stable versions from 1.10.0 to 1.23
    * Windows: x86, x64, arm, arm64
    * Linux: i386, amd64, arm, arm64
    * Darwin: amd64, arm64
  * C/C++
    * Windows (MSVC):
      * Architectures: arm, arm64, i386, amd64
      * Packages: ATL, CTL, MFC, Windows SDK 10, Windows SDK 11
    * Linux:
      * Distribution: Ubuntu & Debian
      * Architectures: i386, amd64, arm64, armhf, armel, arm, s390x, mips64el, mipsel, mips, ppc64el
      * Packages: libc6, libselinux1, libpcre2, libidn2, libssl, zlib1g, lib32z1, libunistring, libcurl4-gnutls, libcurl4-nss, libcurl4-openssl, libnghttp2, libidn2, librtmp, libssh, libssh-gcrypt, libpsl, libldap, libzstd, libbrotli, libgnutls28, nettle, libgmp, comerr, libsasl2, libbrotli, libtasn1-6, libkeyutils, libffi, uuid, libprotobuf, heimdal-multidev, musl, libplib, libsdl1.2-bundle (libsdl-console, libsdl-sge, libsdl1.2, libsdl-ocaml, libsdl-image1.2, libsdl-kitchensink, libsdl-mixer1.2, libsdl-net1.2, libsdl-sound1.2, libsdl-ttf2.0, libsdl1.2-compat, libsdl-gfx1.2, libsdl-pango), libsdl2-bundle (libsdl2, libsdl2-gfx, libsdl2-image, libsdl2-mixer, libsdl2-net, libsdl2-ttf)
  * Rust
    * Versions 1.77 to 1.81
    * Windows, 
    * Linux
    * macOS
      * Architectures: arm64, arm, x86, x86-64
      * Operating Systems: Linux, Windows, Macos
      * Compilers: GCC, LLVM, MSVC



This massive improvement means you can now tackle complex binaries faster than before and allows you to save time by focusing on the unknown parts of the code. Perhaps, one of the greatest enhancements in IDA 9.0 is that **we are going to maintain and update the databases with signatures**. Yes, you will not have to worry about that. The signature updates happen automatically whenever the upstream program changes. This means **your signatures stay up-to-date without manual intervention** , ensuring you’re always working with the latest, most accurate information.

![Unveiling IDA Pro 9.0: The New RISC-V Decompiler and Enhanced Disassembler Extensions](https://hex-rays.com/hubfs/9.0-Hero.png)

We’ve been asked numerous times the question – “ _When will IDA support a RISC-V decompilation?_ ”. We are delighted to say that IDA 9.0 will include **RISC-V Decompiler** , and on top of that, the disassembler will support the** T-Head instruction set for the XUANTIE-RV architecture**. Why is it so important to have RISC-V in IDA? The answer is simple – because it is becoming more and more popular. In fact, RISC-V has established itself as a revolutionary architecture, offering an open-source, modular design built on the principles of reduced instruction set computing (RISC). Unlike some proprietary architectures, RISC-V is free to use, modify, and implement, making it a popular choice for hardware designers and engineers looking for flexibility. Its streamlined instruction set and load-store architecture ensure simplicity and efficiency, while optional extensions allow customization based on specific application needs. For reverse engineers, RISC-V presents a unique opportunity. With a fixed 32-bit instruction base, 31 general-purpose registers, and a program counter, it offers a clean and predictable structure for analysis.

It is also important to highlight that RISC-V offers a robust Linux port, supporting both RV32 and RV64 architectures, allowing seamless integration with open-source development environments. This port includes essential components such as the Linux kernel, U-Boot bootloader, and GCC/LLVM toolchains, ensuring full system functionality on RISC-V hardware.

There are many occasions when you would need to analyze such a binary:

  * Security Audits: Finding vulnerabilities in RISC-V processors.
  * IP Theft Investigation: Checking for unauthorized use of designs.
  * Compatibility Checks: Ensuring hardware works with specific software.
  * Performance Tuning: Optimizing the processor for custom applications.
  * Hardware Modification: Modding processors for enhanced or altered functionality.



Now, take a moment to explore the examples below. With the RISC-V decompiler, introduced in IDA 9.0, the analysis process is much more streamlined, intuitive, and accurate.
